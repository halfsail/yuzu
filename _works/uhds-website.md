I have been working on the Oregon State University Housing and Dining department for a little over two year. During my time there I have been responsible for updating and maintaining the departments site. 

Besides updating the site. I have slowly rebuilding various sections to improve the design and user experience.

The returning student pages is the latest rebuild on the site. The page is designed to be more open and scannable by returning students.

The new dining plan page and resident hall page has been the biggest project to date. Taking a little over a year to get approvable.

### More updates to come.
