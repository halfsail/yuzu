I had the pleasure of working with the fine folks at Chewse' in the spring of 2019. [Chewse](https://www.chewse.com/) is an office catering startup based in San Francisco with five other locations across the country. The company's goal is to connect people and serve their communities through food. 

I was asked to create a set of icons showing off some of their food selections as well as the portion sizes. These icons would be used in their online dashboard. Making icons is always a fun yet challenging task, working with the Chewse branding was interesting because of the interesting angle and subtle halftone shading.
