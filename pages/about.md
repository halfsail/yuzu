Currently working with CMD Agency as a studio designer.

I like to think big, but Iâ€™m pragmatic in my day-to-day work and can take fast decisions on what needs to be done in the short term.

While interface design is the core of my expertise, experience in front-end development and traditional graphic round out my perspective. I have experience managing multi-stakeholder creative processes and am self-motivated but able to adapt to different team structures.
Based in Oregon.
